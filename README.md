### About
I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language and bring back old memories of old games I used to play.  I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code.

### Requirement
 * The .igf files (The Game)
 * 7-Zip is a file archiver with a high compression ratio. Actually any ZIP/UnZip tools will do.
 * Windows Media Player (WMPlayer.ocx), with latest codec

### Demo
 - Goto https://goo.gl/hkh7gh and download "demo.zip" into *My Documents\igfiction\pack, 
 - then run the script or compiled files (grinfico.exe)
 - open it
