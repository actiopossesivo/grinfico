# IgFE
Interactive Graphical Fictions Engine

Create your own Interactive Fiction with this free, easy to use application for Windows

### About
I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language and bring back old memories of old games I used to play.  I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code. 

### Requirement
 * The .igf files (The Game)
 * 7-Zip is a file archiver with a high compression ratio. Actually any ZIP/UnZip tools will do.
 * Windows Media Player (WMPlayer.ocx), with latest codec

### Demo
Goto https://goo.gl/hkh7gh and download "demo.zip" into \igf\games, then run the script or compiled files (.exe)

### Authoring
See the wiki(https://github.com/actiopossesivo/igfiction/wiki)
